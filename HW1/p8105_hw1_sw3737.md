# Problem 1

``` r
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

``` r
num_rows <- nrow(early_january_weather)
num_cols <- ncol(early_january_weather)
mean_temp <- mean(early_january_weather$temp)
```

The dataset contains weather-related information recorded at various
time points. The variables in the `early_january_weather` dataset
include `origin`,
`year`,`month`,`day`,`hour`,`temp`,`dewp`,`humid`,`wind_dir`,`wind_speed`,`wind_gust`,`precip`,`pressure`,`visib`,`time_hour`.
There are `15 columns` and `358 rows`. The `mean temperature` is
`39.58 F`.

``` r
library(ggplot2)
scatter_plot <- ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Temperature vs Time Hour",
       x = "Time Hour",
       y = "Temperature (°C)",
       color = "Humidity (%)") +
  theme_minimal()
ggsave("scatterplot_temperature_vs_time_hour.png", scatter_plot, width = 8, height = 6)
```

The plot reveals a clear `daily pattern` in temperature. The temperature
tends to
`rise during the daytime hours and fall during the nighttime hours`. The
warmest temperatures are typically observed around midday. Humidity
levels are generally
`higher during the nighttime and early morning hours when temperatures are lower`.
The `highest temperature on the 14th`. The
`humidity from January 11th to 14th remained a high level (>80)`. There
are also a few `outlier points` that deviate significantly from the main
pattern.

# Problem 2

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

``` r
hw1_df = tibble(
  sample = rnorm(10),
  norm_sample_log = sample > 0, 
  vec_char = c("Rock","Jazz","Pop","Hip-hop","Classical","Country","Blues","Electronic","Reggae","R&B"),
  fac_char = factor(c("low","medium","high","low","medium","high","low","medium","high","low"))
)

mean(pull(hw1_df, sample))
```

    ## [1] 0.3918883

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, norm_sample_log))
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, fac_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, fac_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,norm_sample_log))
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,fac_char))
```

At first, I can’t calculate the mean of variable `vec_char` and
`fac_char`. `vec_char` is not numeric or logical, thus returning NA.
`fac_char` is not numeric or logical, thus returning NA. After using
`numeric function`, there are no more warnings. `norm_sample_log` and
`fac_char` can be calculated. However, `vec_char` still returning NA.
